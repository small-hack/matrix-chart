Digests, pins, rollbacks, replacements and pinDigest updates are deliberately ignored since in our use case, these need a manual decision about the version bump for the chart. This can be removed when https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/8231 is implemented and enabled. See also CORE-2434 which tracks this issue.",
